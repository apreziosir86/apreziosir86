**Civil engineer - Professor**

I am a curious person who tries his best to add programming skills to his knowledge. This github profile is a collection of somehow useful codes in different languages to solve undergrad problems in numerical methods, basic CFD and some statistics. All of the code is developed by my own and may not be as optimal as a skilled programmer may expect... In other words, if you see better ways to do the things I'm doing, let me know.
