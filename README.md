**Civil engineer - Professor**

I am a curious person who tries his best to add programming skills to his knowledge. This github profile is a collection of somehow useful codes in different languages to solve undergrad problems in numerical methods, basic CFD and some statistics with comments in spanish and sometimes in English. All of the code is developed by my own and may not be as optimal as a skilled programmer may expect... In other words, if you see better ways to do the things I'm doing, let me know. 
Oh! Also... Big fan of open source software

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª A little bit of me...</h3></summary>
   I am a civil engineer with a PhD in numerical modeling of hydrosystems. When I started grad school I thought that programming was going to be a small part of my life. However, things did not go that way and I started learning numerical computing in different languages. First, I tried with Matlab and R, and later on I changed to Python. In parallel, my computer broke, I had not enough money to buy a new one and I had to install Linux on my laptop to bring it to life again. From that moment on, I am a Linux user 100% of the time. I am building this github to have a place to store all the code I produce for my students and for some personal projects.
